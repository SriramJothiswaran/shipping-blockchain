  "readme": "# Composer-Runtime\n\n`npm install composer-runtime --save`\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis repository contains the core runtime code for Fabric Composer.\nThe runtime code is deployed to the Blockchain, and provides the support for managing\nbusiness networks, registries and resources, and execution of transaction processor\nfunctions.\n\nThe runtime code is designed so that it can be executed on both a real Blockchain\nimplementation (Hyperledger Fabric) and also standalone in a web browser for rapid\ndevelopment and testing purposes. To ensure that this is possible, the code in\nthis repository must be kept isolated from the underlying Blockchain technology.\n\n## Runtime Components\n\nThe Fabric Composer runtime is split into several components to allow\nthe runtime code to execute in multiple environments. Those components are as follows:\n\n![Runtime overview](./images/overview.png)\n\n### Container\n\nThe runtime code in this repository is hosted in a **Container**. The **Container**\nis responsible for starting the **Engine**, routing calls from the client and\nadministrative APIs into the **Engine**, and exposing the Blockchain to the **Engine**\nvia a set of **Services**.\n\nTwo **Container** implementations currently exist:\n\n* Hyperledger Fabric (Go): [Composer-Runtime-Hyperledger-Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/tree/develop/packages/composer-runtime-hlf)\n* Web/in-browser (JavaScript): [Composer-Runtime-Web](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/tree/develop/packages/composer-runtime-web)\n\nThe **Container** interface is defined in [lib/container.js](./lib/container.js).\n\n### Engine\n\nThe **Engine** provides all of the core code for managing business networks,\nregistries and resources, and execution of transaction processor functions. Calls\nfrom the client and administrative APIs are handled by the generic `Engine.init`, `Engine.invoke`, or `Engine.query` functions in [lib/engine.js](./lib/engine.js)\nwhich then forward the call onto the specific handler functions.\n\nThe specific handler functions are organised into separate files:\n\n* Business Network management: [lib/engine.businessnetworks.js](./lib/engine.businessnetworks.js)\n* Registry management: [lib/engine.registries.js](./lib/engine.registries.js)\n* Resource management: [lib/engine.resources.js](./lib/engine.resources.js)\n* Transaction execution: [lib/engine.transactions.js](./lib/engine.transactions.js)\n\nThe **Container** will start a single instance of the **Engine** and make multiple\ncalls to it. The **Engine** code must also support multiple *in-flight* requests, and this is made possible by the **Context** which is passed into the **Engine** by the **Container**.\n\n### Services\n\nA set of **Services** are provided by the **Container** for use by the **Engine**.\nThe current set of **Services** that must be provided by the **Container** are:\n\n* The *logging service*, for writing log entries: [lib/loggingservice.js](./lib/loggingservice.js)\n* The *data service*, for interacting with the world state: [lib/dataservice.js](./lib/dataservice.js)\n\nThere are two different types of **Services**:\n\n* **Container** level services, available from the **Container** interface.\n* **Context** level services, available from the **Context** interface.\n\nThe **Container** level services are not linked to the request, such as the logging\nservice. The **Context** level services are linked to the request, such as the data service.\n",
